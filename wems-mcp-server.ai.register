# WEMS MCP Server — AI Version Register
CURRENT VERSION: 1.7.3
## Active Features
FEATURE: World Event Monitoring System MCP Server (v1.7.3)
  SIGNATURE: "wems_mcp_server.py" with 11 MCP tools monitoring natural hazards
  FAILURE MODE: API rate limiting from government sources, network timeouts on remote endpoints
  ROLLBACK: Disable specific monitoring tools, use cached responses, implement exponential backoff

FEATURE: Dual-Tier Service Model (v1.0.0)
  SIGNATURE: TIER_FREE and TIER_PREMIUM with feature/result limitations in code
  FAILURE MODE: Tier validation bypassed, premium features accessed without authorization
  ROLLBACK: Remove tier restrictions, make all features free, single service level

FEATURE: 9+ Authoritative Data Sources (v1.7.3)
  SIGNATURE: USGS, NOAA, Smithsonian GVP, NHC, NIFC, OpenAQ, DHS, State Dept, CISA integrations
  FAILURE MODE: Government API changes breaking parsers, XML/JSON schema drift
  ROLLBACK: Pin to specific API versions, implement schema validation, graceful degradation

FEATURE: Real-time Natural Hazard Monitoring (v1.0.0)
  SIGNATURE: Earthquake, tsunami, volcano, solar, hurricane, wildfire, severe weather alerts
  FAILURE MODE: False positive alerts, missing critical events, data staleness
  ROLLBACK: Increase alert thresholds, disable automated notifications, manual verification

FEATURE: Configurable Webhook Alerts (v1.0.0)
  SIGNATURE: configure_alerts tool with threshold customization and webhook endpoints
  FAILURE MODE: Webhook spam from threshold tuning, endpoint failures causing backlog
  ROLLBACK: Disable webhook delivery, local-only alerts, manual configuration only

FEATURE: Geographic Filtering (v1.1.0)
  SIGNATURE: Region/state filtering across multiple monitoring tools
  FAILURE MODE: Incorrect geographic parsing, coordinate system mismatches
  ROLLBACK: Global monitoring only, remove location-based filtering

## Known Bugs
BUG: Hurricane forecast track data inconsistent
  SYMPTOMS: Some storms missing forecast cone data from NHC feeds
  WORKAROUND: Fall back to current position only when forecast unavailable

BUG: Solar flare classification edge cases
  SYMPTOMS: M-class flares occasionally miscategorized as X-class
  WORKAROUND: Add magnitude bounds checking in solar event parser

BUG: Air quality station coordinate precision
  SYMPTOMS: OpenAQ coordinates sometimes truncated affecting location accuracy
  WORKAROUND: Use city-level fallback when coordinates insufficient
